# 🧱 Clean Architecture Template for TypeScript Monorepos

[![Test and Build](https://github.com/thaitype/typescript-clean-architecture/actions/workflows/test-and-build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/thaitype/typescript-clean-architecture/actions/workflows/test-and-build.yml)

This is a **Clean Architecture starter template** designed for monorepos using **Turborepo** + **pnpm** + **TypeScript**. It's simple enough to get started quickly and scalable enough to grow into a large production system.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## 🧠 What is Clean Architecture?

**Clean Architecture** is a way to structure your application so that:

- Business logic is **independent** from frameworks (e.g. Express, Next.js)
- Code is **testable**, **modular**, and easy to **extend**
- Dependencies always point **inward**, from outer layers toward the core

## 🤔 Why This Project Helps You

By leveraging Clean Architecture, this template enables you to:

- ✨ Write framework-agnostic business logic
- 🧪 Test use cases in isolation (no DB or HTTP server needed)
- 🧱 Structure your code for long-term maintainability
- 🧩 Easily swap implementations (e.g. Mongo → Postgres, REST → GraphQL)
- 👥 Onboard teammates faster with a predictable, layered system

## 🛠 Usage (Root-Level Scripts)

The root `package.json` includes common scripts powered by `turbo`:


### Script Descriptions

- `dev`: Run all development servers/command in parallel,
- `build`: Build all packages respecting their dependency graph
- `test`: Run tests across all workspaces, including coverage test
- `test:watch`: Watch and re-run tests interactively
- `lint:check`: Run lint and type checks
- `lint:fix`: Automatically fix lint issues
- `format`: Check Prettier formatting
- `format:fix`: Auto-format using Prettier
- `test:coverage-report`: Run Show summary coverage report for all packages

## How to run package in specific package

For example to run only `cli` package:

```bash
pnpm run dev --filter=cli
```

## 📦 Template Generator

To create a new package, copy and rename the `tools/template` folder:

```bash
cp -r tools/template core/new-package
```

This includes:
- Preconfigured build/dev/test scripts
- Standard tooling via `mono`
- `tsconfig`, `eslint`, `vitest` setup
- Minimal boilerplate with `lib` + test examples

Just update the package name in `package.json` and start coding!

## 🔧 Build Tooling with Turborepo + Mono

### 🧩 Centralized Toolchain via `tools/mono`

We built a custom toolchain named `mono` to easily manage and control the build process across all packages.

Instead of installing build tools like `esbuild`, `vitest`, and `eslint` in every package, we centralize them via:

- `tools/mono`: Unified CLI for commands like `dev`, `test`, `build`
- `configs/*`: Shared config presets for linting, TS, and testing

Example `mono` script:
```ts
const scripts: MonoScripts = {
  'lint:check': 'eslint src',
  'lint:fix': 'eslint src --fix',
  'test': 'vitest run',
  'test:watch': 'vitest watch',
  'build': 'esbuild ./src/index.ts --bundle --minify --platform=node --outfile=dist/index.js',
  'dev': 'tsx watch ./src/index.ts',
  'start': 'tsx ./src/index.ts',
  'check-types': 'tsc --noEmit',
};
```

### 🧪 How packages use `mono`

Each package reuses the `mono` CLI by mapping local scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "mono dev",
    "start": "mono start",
    "build": "mono build",
    "test": "mono test",
    "test:watch": "mono test:watch",
    "lint:check": "mono lint:check",
    "lint:fix": "mono lint:fix",
    "check-types": "mono check-types"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@acme/mono": "workspace:*",
    "@acme/config-eslint": "workspace:*",
    "@acme/config-typescript": "workspace:*",
    "@acme/config-vitest": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

### 🛠 Root `package.json` dependencies

Tools are only installed once at the root:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "turbo": "^2.4.4",
    "@vitest/coverage-istanbul": "^3.0.9",
    "typescript": "^5.8.2",
    "eslint": "^9.22.0",
    "esbuild": "^0.25.1",
    "prettier": "^3.5.3",
    "vitest": "^3.0.9"
  }
}
```

### 🧠 Workspace definition

```yaml
# pnpm-workspace.yaml
packages:
  - "apps/*"
  - "core/*"
  - "packages/*"
  - "configs/*"
  - "tools/*"
```

## 🧠 Dependency Injection

This template uses [`@thaitype/ioctopus`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@thaitype/ioctopus) — a simple, metadata-free IoC container for TypeScript that works across runtimes (Node, Edge, etc). 

However, this project use a forked version of `ioctopus` when the original package is fully support type-safety, this project will switch back to the original package, see [issue#3](https://github.com/thaitype/ioctopus/issues/3)

To resolve any service:

```ts
import { getInjection } from "@acme/di";
const userController = getInjection("UserController");
```

Happy coding! ✨ Let your architecture evolve, not collapse. 🏗️
